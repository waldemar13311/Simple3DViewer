## Simple3DViewer

Hello, everyone!

My program Simple3DViewer can help you to see ðŸ“· STL(stereolithography) 3D models. It was written on C# with using a [SharpGL library](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpgl) and [WPF dark theme](https://github.com/AngryCarrot789/WPFDarkTheme).

Thank you very much for viewing my repo ðŸ¥° and good luck in programing ðŸ˜‰!
